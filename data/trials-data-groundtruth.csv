"Phase II Study Evaluating Radiotherapy-chemotherapy and Cetuximab in Patients With Histologically Proven Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Oral Cavity, Oropharynx, Hypopharynx, or Larynx and With a Poor Prognosis After Complete Surgical ResectionRATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving chemotherapy together with radiation therapy and cetuximab may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well chemotherapy given together with radiation therapy and cetuximab works in treating patients with head and neck cancer.OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Evaluate disease-free survival at 2 years in patients with poor prognosis squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with chemoradiotherapy and cetuximab after complete surgical resection.

Secondary

* Evaluate quality of life.
* Evaluate tolerability.
* Evaluate overall survival.
* Analyze germinal polymorphisms.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive cetuximab IV on day 1. Treatment with cetuximab repeats every week for up to 8 courses. Patients also receive cisplatin IV on day 8. Treatment with cisplatin repeats every 3 weeks for up to 3 courses. Patients undergo concurrent radiotherapy 5 times a week for 7 weeks beginning on day 8.

A Phase II Trial of Hypofractionated Radiotherapy (16 Gy in 2 Fractions With an Interval of One Week) for the Palliation of Complicated Bone Metastases in Patients With Poor Performance StatusLiterature has shown that hypofractionated radiotherapy regimens are efficacious in patients with complicated bone metastases and have a low potential for severe treatment-related toxicities. There is a clear need for hypofractionated schedules in the complicated bone metastases population, especially when considering the overarching aim of palliative radiotherapy and the clinical features of this patient population. As well, current research examining hypofractionated approaches in bone metastases patients with impending or pathologic fractures, neuropathic pain or accompanying soft tissue masses has been markedly scarce.In response the the already commented on, the purpose of this one armed, phase II trial is to determine the efficacy and safety profile of a hypofractionated radiotherapy regimen, 16 Gy in 2 fractions with an interval of one week, for the palliation of complicated bone metastases in patients with poor performance status.;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;TRUE;8;TRUE;16;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;Tox;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE

Recognizing that PEGPH20 has not been previously delivered with radiotherapy but is unlikely to contribute to increased toxicities, this trial will have an abbreviated sequential dose escalation schema for the first three patients. PEGPH20 will be given twice per week for the first 28 days and then weekly for another 2 weeks during radiotherapy. Gemcitabine will be delivered weekly at the first day of radiotherapy and continued weekly, per published literature. Patients will remain on study for three months. The duration of active treatment with PEGPH20 and Gemcitabine plus radiotherapy will continue for 5-6 weeks. Efficacy outcome will occur 6-8 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy.;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;10;TRUE;3;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;TRUE;10;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;Other;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE
"Whole-Brain Radiotherapy (WBRT) vs. WBRT and Integrated Boost Using Helical Tomotherapy for Patients With Multiple Brain Metastases - a Multicentre Randomized Phase II TrialBrain metastases occur in 20-40% of patients with primary extracerebral tumors. Despite important advances in therapy of malignant solid tumors and treatment of 1-3 brain metastases, multiple brain metastases continue to present a significant problem in attempting to prevent progression of disease and limit morbidity associated with therapy. The majority of patients who develop brain metastases have a short survival, effective palliation being transient. The median survival after diagnosis is as low as 3-6 months. However, there is some evidence that selected patients survive prolonged periods with vigorous therapeutic approach.

Specific therapeutic options are surgery, chemotherapy, conventional fractionated whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and radiosurgery. Radiosurgery allows delivering of a single high dose fraction of radiation to targets of 3-3.5 cm maximum diameter. In patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases, a rapid decrease of symptoms, local tumor response rate of 73-90% and a median survival of 7-12 month have been reported.

WBRT alone is the treatment of choice for patients with multiple brain metastases, and for patients with single brain metastases not amenable to surgery or radiosurgery. Median survival after WBRT alone is 3-6 months.

WBRT and radiosurgery boost have been shown to improve survival in RPA class I patients and in patients with favorable histological status and squamous cell or non-small cell lung tumors. All randomized trials showed improved local control with the addition of radiosurgery to WBRT (Andrews, 2004).

WBRT in conjunction with radiosurgery improves local control and reduces the risk of new distant brain metastases, but most studies support that combined radiosurgery and WBRT does not improve the overall survival expect for patients without evidence of extracranial disease.

Helical Tomotherapy (HT) allows as a sole modality a new treatment option: Using HT, the advantage of applying a highly conformal boost dose to the metastases and WBRT can be combined in one treatment session. Therefore, it allows applying a high dose to multiple brain metastases in the sense of an integrated boost. The focus of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of WBRT with an integrated boost using this new treatment modality in comparison to the effects of conventional WBRT alone.

The principal objective of the trial is to assess the therapeutic efficacy of WBRT as compared to WBRT combined with integrated boost with HT delivered to patients with 2-10 brain metastases of solid tumors. The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of WBRT as opposed to WBRT combined with integrated boost as delivered by HT in patients with 2-10 brain metastases.";TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;Other;FALSE;;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE
"Propylene Glycol-Free Melphalan HCl (EVOMELAÂ®) in Combination With Fludarabine and Total Body Irradiation Based Reduced Intensity Conditioning for Haploidentical TransplantationThis is an open-label, single-arm, phase II study to determine the safety of propylene glycol-free melphalan HCl (EVOMELAÂ®), in combination with fludarabine and total-body irradiation-based reduced-intensity conditioning for haploidentical transplantation. In addition, the study evaluates the one-year progression-free survival of patients undergoing this treatment.OVERVIEW:

Elderly and infirm patients with hematological malignancies often cannot undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) because of high-toxicity rates and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) associated with higher-intensity conditioning allografts.

Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) transplantation has emerged as an attractive alternative for these populations.

FLUDARABINE/MELPHALAN. In RIC, fludarabine is often used as the lymphocyte-depleting component to facilitate donor-cell engraftment. This drug can be given once daily because of its plasma half-life. M.D. Anderson pioneered the use of fludarabine melphalan (FLU/MEL) conditioning, which has since gained wide usage. (1) Melphalan is convenient, has broad antitumor activity in hematologic malignancies and has immunosuppressive effects. The Flu/Mel conditioning regimen can provide long-term disease control, especially in the subset of patients with chemo sensitive disease. (1) TOTAL-BODY IRRADIATION. In a recent study, total-body irradiation (200 cGy) was used with flu/mel for advanced lymphoma treated with HCT. With a median follow-up time close to two years, the survival of these mostly advanced, relapsed/refractory patients was very encouraging with overall survival of 54% and progression-free survival of 54% for the entire group. (2) Treatment-related mortality was low at day 100 (9.1%) and two years (19%) after transplantation, with stable engraftment achieved in the great majority of patients.

PROPYLENE GLYCOL-FREE MELPHALAN HCL (EVOMELAÂ®). In theory, intensifying the dose of melphalan in flu/mel conditioning could provide better disease control post HCT, allowing more time for curative graft-versus-leukemia effects to emerge. The use of the commercial formulation of melphalan (AlkeranÂ®) proved somewhat problematic, however, because it must be reconstituted with propylene glycol, a substance that has been associated with toxic side effects. The substitution of CaptisolÂ® in propylene glycol-free melphalan HCl (EVOMELAÂ®) for Injection (Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) for the excipients found in AlkeranÂ®, directly overcomes the formulation limitations noted with AlkeranÂ®.

STUDY RATIONALE. The preliminary data suggest that the substitution of CaptisolÂ® in EVOMELAÂ® for the excipients found in AlkeranÂ® directly overcomes the formulation limitations and provides a potentially safer melphalan formulation for administration at higher doses used in HCT conditioning regimens.

Based on these observations, we now propose a phase II study of a RIC regimen consisting of EVOMELAÂ® in combination with fludarabine and total-body irradiation for patients undergoing haplo-HCT. The study will investigate the safety and tolerability of this conditioning approach. While the FDA indication for EVOMELAÂ® is for myeloablative conditioning prior to autologous HCT in patients with multiple myeloma, we anticipate our study will provide critical preliminary data to explore this formulation in allogeneic HCT conditioning.";FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;;TRUE;12;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;;TRUE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;Tox;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE
"Multicentre, Phase I/II Study of Fractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Medically Inoperable Early Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)A new type of treatment called stereotactic radiotherapy has recently been developed in hopes of improving the success of the treatment and improving the convenience to patients, while reducing the side effects. This study is developing stereotactic radiotherapy as a state-of-the-art treatment for lung cancer patients.OBJECTIVES:

Primary Objectives

* To determine the efficacy of hypofractionated, image guided radiotherapy in treating patients with lung tumours, with the primary outcome being local control at one year.

"A Phase 1 Study of Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy and Concurrent HIV Protease Inhibitor Nelfinavir as Part of a Neoadjuvant Regimen in Patients With Locally Advanced Pancreatic CancerThis phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of stereotactic radiation therapy and nelfinavir mesylate when given together with gemcitabine hydrochloride, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil in treating patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Stereotactic radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs, such as nelfinavir mesylate, may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving stereotactic radiation therapy and nelfinavir mesylate together with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To establish the safety, dose-limiting toxicities and maximally tolerated dose of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy concurrently with nelfinavir in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer given as part of a neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy regimen.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the surgical complete resection rate. II. To evaluate the pathological response. III. To evaluate tumor response on computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

IV. To evaluate the correlation between the radiologic response and pathologic response.

I. To measure phospho-AKT expression in pancreatic tumor tissue prior to and following the neoadjuvant chemo-radiation program. (Correlative) II. To measure nelfinavir pharmacokinetics at steady-state. (Correlative) III. To measure the pharmacogenomic status of CYP2C19\*2 (G681A) in the study population. (Correlative)

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) and concurrent nelfinavir mesylate.

NEOADJUVANT THERAPY: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV over 30 minutes, and fluorouracil IV continuously over 24 hours on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive nelfinavir mesylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) beginning in week 9 and continuing until the completion of SRT or until 14 days after the completion of SRT. Patients undergo concurrent SRT once daily for 5 days in week 11.

SURGERY AND ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY: Approximately 2-3 weeks after completion of SRT, patients undergo restaging to evaluate disease response. Patients with resectable or potentially resectable disease and no metastasis undergo definitive surgery 2-3 weeks later. Approximately 1 month after surgery, these patients receive three additional courses of gemcitabine hydrochloride, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil as above. Patients with unresectable disease that is stable or responsive at the time of surgical exploration may resume treatment with gemcitabine hydrochloride, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil as above in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with metastatic disease at the time of restaging are removed from the study.

"A Phase III Trial of Adjuvant Chemotherapy Following Chemoradiation as Primary Treatment for Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer Compared to Chemoradiation Alone: The OUTBACK TrialThis randomized phase III trial studies how well giving cisplatin and radiation therapy together with or without carboplatin and paclitaxel works in treating patients with cervical cancer has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, carboplatin, and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of \[cancer/tumor\] cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. External radiation therapy uses high-energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Internal radiation uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving cisplatin and external and internal radiation therapy together with carboplatin and paclitaxel kills more tumor cells.PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine if the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy to standard cisplatin-based chemoradiation improves overall survival.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the progression-free survival rates. II. To determine acute and long-term toxicities. III. To determine patterns of disease recurrence. IV. To determine the association between radiation protocol compliance and outcomes.

Through previous research, this Study Drug has shown potential to control some of the recurrent malignant gliomas, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma, and malignant mixed oligoastrocytoma.

The Study Drug is made by combining a human protein (IL13) with a portion of a bacterial toxin protein, Pseudomonas Exotoxin (PE). The IL13 portion binds to receptors on the tumor like a ""key to a lock,"" allowing the PE portion to enter and kill those cells. Since tumor cells preferentially bind the drug, normal (healthy) brain cells are much less likely to be damaged by the drug.

The Study Drug is delivered through tubing or catheters placed directly into the area surrounding the resection cavity. These catheters will be surgically placed within 14 days after the tumor has been removed. A pump is then used to slowly push the drug solution through the catheters using convection-enhanced delivery (CED) over a period of 4 days.

Following treatment with IL13-PE38QQR, all patients will receive standard courses of radiation therapy. In addition, some patients will receive adjuvant temozolomide with radiation therapy and continue with temozolomide after radiation therapy is completed.

Temozolomide is an anti-cancer drug that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and sold for the treatment of recurrent GBM.

This study will determine the maximum tolerated dose of IL13-PE38QQR when administered by CED after tumor resection and prior to radiation therapy with or without adjuvant temozolomide. Patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma who have had a gross total resection of their tumor and who meet all other specified eligibility criteria may be entered into the study.

Patients will be divided into 2 groups:

1. Stratum A - will receive treatment with IL13-PE38QQR followed by radiation therapy and
2. Stratum B - will receive treatment with IL13-PE38QQR followed by radiation therapy with adjuvant temozolomide. Treatment with temozolomide for Stratum B will continue after radiation therapy is completed.

Subgroups (cohorts) of patients will be treated with up to 3 doses of IL13-PE38QQR. Cohorts of 3-6 patients will be treated at each dose level. Enrollment into each subsequent cohort will be dependent upon the safety and tolerability of treatment in the previous cohort.

All patients will need to have histopathological confirmation of malignant glioma diagnosis from tissue sample obtained at the time of gross total resection within 14 days of stereotactic catheter placement. Each patient will have 2-4 standard microinfusion catheters placed and infusion of IL13-PE38QQR will begin within 24 hours of catheter placement. The infusion will last for 96 hours. Approximately 2 weeks after completion of infusion, imaging for radiation therapy planning, a physical examination, and neurological and laboratory assessments will be performed. Patients, if stable, will then receive standard fractionated external beam radiation therapy with a total dose between 5940-6100 cGy using 180 to 200 cGy per fraction.

For those patients assigned to receive temozolomide in combination with radiation therapy, the dose of temozolomide will be administered on each day of radiation therapy and will be based on the patient's body surface area BSA at a dose of 75 mg/mÂ²/day. After radiation therapy is completed and the follow-up MRI has revealed stable disease or a response, patients will continue temozolomide using repeat scheduled dosing at 150 -200 mg/mÂ²/day for 5 consecutive days per 28 day cycle. Treatment cycles will continue for up to 12 cycles.";FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;2;TRUE;61;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;Tox;FALSE;;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE

"A Phase III Trial for Locally Recurrent, Previously Irradiated Head and Neck Cancer: Concurrent Re-Irradiation and Chemotherapy Versus Chemotherapy AloneRATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Cisplatin and paclitaxel may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) and giving them with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving radiation therapy together with combination chemotherapy is more effective than giving combination chemotherapy alone in treating head and neck cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy and combination chemotherapy to see how well they work compared to combination chemotherapy alone in treating patients with recurrent head and neck cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Compare overall survival of patients with previously irradiated unresectable locally recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with radiotherapy, cisplatin, and paclitaxel vs cisplatin-based chemotherapy alone.

Secondary

* Compare progression-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.
* Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.
* Compare quality of life, functional/performance status, and quality-adjusted survival of patients treated with these regimens.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy twice daily and receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 30 minutes once daily on days 1-5, 15-19, 29-33, and 43-47. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once daily on days 6-13, 20-27, 34-41, and 48-55.
* Arm II: Patients receive 1 of the following cisplatin-based\* regimens at the discretion of the treating physician:

* Regimen 1: Patients receive cisplatin\* IV over 1-2 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV continuously over 96 hours on days 1-4.
* Regimen 2: Patients receive cisplatin\* IV over 1-2 hours and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1.
* Regimen 3: Patients receive cisplatin\* IV over 1-2 hours and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1.

NOTE: \*Carboplatin may be substituted for cisplatin in patients with creatinine clearance \< 50 mL/min or in patients who experience grade 2 or 3 neurotoxicity.

For all regimens, treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond documentation of CR.

Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

"A Phase I Study of Induction AMG 479 and Gemcitabine, Followed by AMG 479, Capecitabine, and 3D-Conformal Radiation Therapy (3D-CRT) With Subsequent Maintenance Therapy for Locally Advanced Pancreatic CancerRATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as ganitumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Specialized radiation therapy, such as 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, that delivers a high-dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of ganitumab when given together with gemcitabine hydrochloride followed by radiation therapy, ganitumab, capecitabine, and maintenance therapy in treating patients with locally advanced cancer of the pancreas.OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To evaluate the maximum dose of ganitumab, up to a target dose of 20 mg/kg, given concurrently with capecitabine and radiotherapy following induction ganitumab and gemcitabine hydrochloride in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

Secondary

* To evaluate the safety profile of induction therapy comprising ganitumab and gemcitabine hydrochloride, followed by ganitumab and concurrent chemoradiation, and subsequently by maintenance ganitumab and gemcitabine hydrochloride until disease progression in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
* To evaluate response and overall survival of patients treated at the maximum dose of ganitumab given concurrently with capecitabine and radiotherapy following induction ganitumab and subsequently followed by maintenance ganitumab and gemcitabine hydrochloride until disease progression.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of ganitumab followed by an expanded cohort study.

"A Phase III Randomized Trial Evaluating Chemotherapy Followed by Pelvic Reirradiation Versus Chemotherapy Alone as Pre-operative Treatment for Locally Recurrent Rectal Cancer (GRECCAR - PRODIGE - FRENCH)GRECCAR 15 is focused on Locally Recurrent Rectal Cancer (LRRC) for patients with previous pelvic radiotherapy for the primary rectal cancer. This situation leads to a 20% higher risk of non-curative resection for the LRRC management (R1 status) impacting significantly the overall survival. The widespread use of neoadjuvant radiotherapy for primary rectal cancer introduces this new problem: the treatment of LRRC in previously irradiated area.

The objective of GRECCAR 15 is to assess the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by pelvic reirradiation versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone on the rate of curative surgery (R0) in previously irradiated patients with LRRC.The incidence of rectal cancer in the European Union is 15-25/100 000 per year. There is a 5-10% rate of locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC), with an overall survival rate of 40% at 5 years after complete resection. Curative surgery of LRRC requires multi-visceral resections which are associated with significant post-operative morbidity of 60%. Despite the combination of a potential curability and the high post-operative morbidity, there are currently neither good data from prospective randomized studies regarding optimum preoperative treatments for LRRC nor is there data assessing the efï¬cacy of response to any such treatments. Moreover, the widespread use of neoadjuvant radiotherapy for primary cancer introduced a new problem: the treatment of LRRC in previously irradiated area. Some studies investigated various modalities of reirradiation and showed acceptable late toxicity and encouraging outcome. GRECCAR 15 would be the first prospective randomized trial so far to evaluate the interest of pelvic reirradiation for LRRC, in previously irradiated patients.

The objective is to assess the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by pelvic reirradiation versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone on the rate of curative surgery (R0) in previously irradiated patients with LRRC.

"High-Dose-Rate Prostate Brachytherapy Combined With Stereotactic Ablative Prostate Radiotherapy for Patients Diagnosed With Intermediate and High-risk Prostate Cancer. Phase II Clinical Trial.Dose escalation is nowadays a standard strategy in radiotherapy for prostate cancer. Besides, it is believed that due to the radiobiology characteristics of prostate cells (low alpha/beta ratio), the delivery of higher radiation doses per fraction could theoretically improve the efficacy of the treatment. In this context, the combination of prostate brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) has proven to be the most effective method of dose escalation significantly improving disease control in randomized clinical trials. Unfortunately, this strategy is also associated with an increased risk of acute and late adverse events compared to conventional EBRT alone. It has been proposed that this increase in adverse events could be related to the use Low-Dose-Rate (LDR) brachytherapy and that High-Dose-Rate (HDR) brachytherapy (a more modern and accurate procedure) could reduce this risk.

On the other hand, Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) is a high-precision radiation technique that allows the delivery of higher doses per fraction in fewer sessions, reducing the total treatment time.

The investigators hypothesized that the combination of two highly conformal radiation techniques (HDR brachytherapy and SABR) could be well tolerated, while reducing total treatment time and therefore improving patient quality of life.

"A Phase I Trial of Hypofractionated Proton Radiation Therapy With Cisplatin and Etoposide Followed by Surgery in Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung CancerThis research study is looking at an alternative way of delivering radiation therapy with protons. Protons are tiny particles with a positive charge that can be controlled to travel a certain distance and stop inside the body. In theory, this allows better control of where the radiation dose is delivered as compared to photons. Information from other research studies suggests that proton radiation may help to reduce unwanted side effects from radiation and allow an increase in radiation dose that increase the odds of tumor killing.

"A Phase II Study of Bevacizumab in Combination With Docetaxel and Radiation in Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Cancer of the Head and NeckRATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving bevacizumab together with docetaxel and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bevacizumab together with docetaxel and radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage III or stage IV head and neck cancer.OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the time to progression in patients with stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with bevacizumab in combination with docetaxel and radiotherapy.

Secondary

* Compare the objective response rate, locoregional control rate, duration of response, patterns of failure, and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 8 weeks and receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour once a week for 8 weeks. Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes once every 2 weeks for up to 1 year.

"Single-arm, Single-center, Exploratory Phase II Clinical Study of Envafolimab Combined With Chemoradiotherapy in the Treatment of Locally Advanced pMMR/MSS Rectal CancerPreoperative radiotherapy combined with 5-fluorouracil/capecitabine is currently the standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer. Although this strategy effectively reduces the risk of local recurrence, it fails to effectively improve the overall survival rate of patients . The root cause is that 5-fluorouracil/capecitabine based local radiotherapy is not effective in controlling potential micrometastases. Therefore, many studies try to combine preoperative radiotherapy with more intense chemotherapy and targeted drugs at the same time, as well as induction chemotherapy before preoperative radiotherapy and consolidation chemotherapy after, in order to obtain better efficacy. However, a number of studies have shown that increasing cytotoxic drugs fail to effectively improve pathologic complete response rate (pCR) and long-term survival rate, and significantly increase therapeutic toxicity . Therefore, the idea of trying to increase the efficacy of cytotoxic drugs by accumulating them does not work.Based on the use of PD-1/PD-L1 antibody in colorectal cancer and other solid tumors, and referring to the scheme of PD-1/PD-L1 antibody combined with radiotherapy in other solid tumors, we added envafolimab to local radiotherapy for advanced rectal cancer for exploration, with a view to further improving the pCR rate and long-term survival of patients.Inclusion criteriaï¼š

"Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Irradiation Treated With Brachytherapy Remedial: Phase 2 StudyAfter a curative treatment by radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer, between 20% and 50% of patients may have a biological relapse as a progressive re -rise of PSA. After prostate brachytherapy with low flow, this rate is between 2% and 6%. Depending on risk factors initially present, some patients will have a micro metastatic disease at the time of re-rise, but others will have a true local recurrence purely intra-prostate. Local recurrence after radiotherapy is associated with a high incidence of distant metastatic relapse and poor overall survival. For these reasons, the possibility of offering a local treatment for this selected population of patients can have a major therapeutic interest and allow changing a situation often considered palliative to the possibility of a second curative treatment.

Currently, there is no consensus regarding the optimal management of patients with purely local recurrence after prostate irradiation at first intention. When an external radiotherapy or brachytherapy is performed as first choice in a patient with prostate cancer, several remedial treatments have been proposed, with controversial results the decision-making for clinicians and for difficult patients. These main therapeutic options remedial (surgery, cryotherapy and brachytherapy) have the potential for complications such as rectal injury, impotence or incontinence Brachytherapy is a new salvage treatment being evaluated in the United States (Phase II study of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group No. 0526). Several retrospective trials have shown very encouraging results in terms of acute toxicity and biochemical control in the short term. Thus, a team from Mount Sinai in New York recently published for the first time 10 years retrospective results with this approach. In their experience after treatment failures with external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy, a dose of 122 Gy was delivered over 90% of the prostate gland. Doing this they observed biochemical control rates and survival specific of 54 % and 96 %, respectively at 10 years, with an hormone treatment associated (median 6 months) in 84 % of cases. Four patients had grade 3 toxicity or higher (11%). To reduce the rate of late toxicities the team from the University Of California San Francisco (UCSF), tested focal brachytherapy guided by functional MRI (MRI spectroscopy) to re-treat local recurrence after initial brachytherapy as monotherapy or boost. By delivering 144 Gy on recidivism objectified on MRI, the authors observed that a minimal dose of 37Gy covered 90 % of the prostate gland to treat the risk of microscopic disease. Doing this, the rate of observed toxicities and biochemical control appeared encouraging, with a median follow-up of 2 years, since no grade 3 toxicity was observed and 74% of patients achieved a PSA nadir \<0.5 ng / mL without associated hormone. In case of external radiation or brachytherapy, several attempts proposed to associate an injection of hyaluronic acid gel to the prostate - rectum interface to spare healthy tissue irradiated and thus reduce the rate of radiation proctitis. The feasibility of implementing this gel has been demonstrated in patients with non- irradiated tissues. No inherent toxicity of the injection of hyaluronic acid gel has been described after prostate brachytherapy first line. The feasibility of this injection remains unproven to date on patients previously irradiated externally or by brachytherapy. We hypothesize that the risk of radiation proctitis and fistulas front prostate could be reduced using this technique in this indication.

We propose to carry out a French prospective multicenter phase II trial combining brachytherapy remedial with an injection of hyaluronic acid after surgery to reduce the risk of radiation proctitis and / or recto -urinary fistula in a patient population hyper- selected with a high probability of isolated local recurrence.";FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;;FALSE;;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;TRUE;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;Tox;FALSE;;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE
"A Safety Run-in/Randomized Phase II Trial of EMD 121974 in Conjunction With Concomitant and Adjuvant Temozolomide With Radiation Therapy in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma MultiformeCilengitide may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Giving cilengitide together with temozolomide and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. This randomized phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of cilengitide when given together with temozolomide and radiation therapy and to compare how well they work in treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiformePRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the safety profile of EMD 121974 (cilengitide) when administered as a one-hour infusion twice a week concurrently with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide with radiation therapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. (Safety Run-In)

II. To estimate overall survival in newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma multiforme treated with EMD 121974 concurrently with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide with radiation therapy. (Phase II)

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To estimate and compare overall survival between a low dose treatment group and a high dose treatment group in newly diagnosed patients with glioblastoma multiforme treated with EMD 121974 concurrently with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide with radiation therapy. (Phase II)

II. To determine the toxicity of EMD 121974 (cilengitide) when it is administered in conjunction with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide with radiation therapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. (Phase II)

III. To evaluate the molecular profile of individual patients and correlate molecular expression profiles with clinical outcomes. (Phase II)

IV. To characterize tumor blood volume, tumor blood flow, and permeability ratios using perfusion MR in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme and follow these parameters during treatment with EMD 121974 (cilengitide). (Phase II)

OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, safety run-in study of cilengitide followed by a randomized phase II study.

Safety Run-In:

INITIATION COURSE: Patients receive cilengitide IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 4. Treatment repeats weekly for 10 weeks. Patients also receive oral temozolomide and undergo radiotherapy one hour later on days 1-5 of weeks 1-6.

MAINTENANCE COURSES: Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5 in courses 1-6. Patients also receive cilengitide IV on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 25. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of cilengitide (3 Pre-defined study dose levels are defined as: 500, 1000 and 2000mg). The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 3 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. If no MTD (maximum tolerable dose) is defined through three steps of the dose escalation process, we will pursue the phase II safety/efficacy study with randomized treatment allocation. Patients will be randomized into one of two pre-specified treatment dosage arms, 500mg group or 2000mg group.

PHASE II:

Patients are stratified according to age (50 and under vs over 50), Karnofsky performance score (60%-80% vs 90%-100%), and tumor status (measurable vs nonmeasurable). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

ARM I: Patients receive radiotherapy and temozolomide as in safety run-in initiation course and cilengitide at the lower dose as in safety run-in initiation and maintenance courses.

ARM II: Patients receive radiotherapy and temozolomide as in safety run-in initiation course and cilengitide at the higher dose as in safety run-in initiation and maintenance courses.

Patients are followed every 2 months.

"A Phase II Randomized Study Assessing the Efficacy of Proton Craniospinal Irradiation (CSI) vs Involved-field Photon Radiation Therapy for Leptomeningeal Metastases From Solid Tumor MalignanciesThe investigators are doing this study to find out whether proton craniospinal radiation therapy (proton CSI) or partial photon radiation therapy is more effective at preventing leptomeningeal metastasis from worsening. The proton CSI targets the entire space containing the CSF, brain, and spinal fluid. The partial photon radiation therapy treats only areas where the patient is having symptoms, such as the entire brain or part of the spine.

"A Phase I/II Trial of PARP Inhibition, Radiation, and Immunotherapy in Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer (ES-SCLC) - PRIO TrialThis phase I/II trials investigates the side effects of olaparib and durvalumab and how well it works in combination with carboplatin, etoposide, and/or radiation therapy in treating patients with extensive stage-small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) who have not received treatment for their disease. PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, can keep PARP from working, so tumor cells can't repair themselves, and they may stop growing. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as carboplatin and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy sources to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving olaparib and durvalumab together with carboplatin, etoposide, and/or radiation therapy may help treat patients with ES-SCLC.PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To assess the toxicity and feasibility of sequential treatment with olaparib, thoracic radiotherapy (TRT)/durvalumab, and olaparib/durvalumab for consolidation and maintenance therapy in patients status post (s/p) chemoimmunotherapy for ES-SCLC.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To assess the efficacy of sequential treatment with olaparib, TRT/durvalumab, and olaparib/durvalumab for consolidation and maintenance therapy in patients s/p chemoimmunotherapy for ES-SCLC.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. Perform a comparative analysis of patient clinical outcome according to tumor biomarkers in circulating tumor cell (CTC), blood samples and tumor tissue, such as SLFN11 expression H- scores and stratifying tumors as SLFN11 positive or negative on the basis of H-score \>= 1.

II. Perform a comparative analysis of patient clinical outcome according to immune biomarkers in blood and tumor tissue, such as PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) 22C3 pharmDx assay and stratifying tumors as PD-L1 positive or negative on the basis of PD-L1 combined positive score \>= 1% in patients treated with anti- PD-L1 therapy.

III. Perform whole exome sequencing (WES) and methylation profiling on tumor samples and from circulating-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) to evaluate whether tumor mutational burden (TMB) or specific genomic alterations are associated with improved progression free survival (PFS) with the trial regimen.

IV. Gene and protein expression of tumor tissue through ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing and Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA).

V. Quantify pre-treatment, pre- and post-olaparib, post-TRT, and at progression levels for blood-based biomarkers, such as cytokines associated with immune activation (e.g., STING pathway cytokines, CXCL10 and CCL5) to establish correlations with PFS and overall survival (OS).

VI. Using longitudinal blood samples (e.g. pre-treatment, pre- and post-olaparib, post-TRT, and at progression), assess CTC number, CTC (single-cell) biomarker expression (such as SLFN11 and PD-L1 expression), and immune profile of PBMCs.

VIa. Correlate baseline expression or changes with PFS and OS. VII. Assess pre- and post-olaparib, and at progression tumor tissue for immune markers, such as CD8+ T cells, through multiplex IHC.

"A Prospective Phase III Randomized Trial to Compare Stereotactic Radiosurgery vs. Whole Brain Radiation Therapy for &gt;/= 4 Newly Diagnosed Non-Melanoma Brain MetastasesThis randomized phase III clinical trial compares stereotactic radiosurgery with whole brain radiation therapy to see how well they work in treating patients with non-melanoma cancer that has recently spread from the first location to the brain. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a specialized type of radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Whole brain radiation therapy delivers a lower dose of radiation to the entire brain over several treatments. It is not yet known whether stereotactic radiosurgery works better than whole brain radiation therapy in treating patients with non-melanoma brain metastases. Stereotactic radiosurgery may also cause fewer thinking and memory problems than whole brain radiation therapy.PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To compare local tumor control 4 months after treatment of patients with 4 to 15 intracranial non-melanoma metastases at the time of enrollment (=\< 15 at time of treatment) treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) versus (vs.) whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in a prospective randomized trial.

II. To compare cognitive decline at 4 months defined as a significant decline (5 point decrease from baseline based on the reliable change index) in Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised (HVLT-R) Total Recall after initial treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) versus whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in patients with 4 to 15 non-melanoma brain metastases at the time of enrollment (=\< 15 at time of treatment).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine local control and distant tumor control in the brain at 1, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months post treatment.

II. To determine overall survival in each treatment arm. III. To assess the pattern of neurocognitive change in memory at 1, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months post-treatment as well as executive function, attention, processing speed, and upper extremity fine motor dexterity.

IV. To evaluate the composite neurocognitive function score for both treatment arms.

V. To assess the pre-treatment factors of age, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), and extra-cranial disease in the predictive determination of local and distant control and neurocognitive outcome in each treatment arm.

VI. To assess the correlation between number of lesions and total volume of intracranial disease and neurocognitive outcome in each treatment arm.

VII. To compare time to initiation of systemic therapy from completion of radiotherapy between the two treatment arms.

VIII. To compare number of cycles of systemic therapy delivered following completion of radiation treatment in the two treatment arms.

IX. To document and descriptively compare post-treatment adverse side effects between the two treatment arms.

It is known that neoadjuvant therapy is vital for improved survival, which has been confirmed in previous studies that neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy provides superior overall compared with upfront surgery. However, question of whether the addition of radiotherapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy can improve prognosis compared with chemotherapy alone is a challenging matter. Also, no studies have evaluated the efficacy of S-1 as the neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen for BRPC albeit similar prognosis has been found between S-1 and gemcitabine in advanced pancreatic cancer. In this trial, patients with biopsy and radiographically confirmed BRPC will be randomly allocated into three groups: neoadjuvant gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel, neoadjuvant gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel with SBRT and neoadjuvant S-1 plus nab-paclitaxel with SBRT. Surgical resection will be performed 3 weeks after SBRT. The primary endpoint is overall survival. The secondary outcomes are progression free survival, pathological complete response rate, R0 resection rate and incidence of adverse effects.

Standard treatment of RCC is surgery. A number of non-surgical treatments of RCC are also available, but are highly invasive and are associated with significant side effects. SBRT is a non-invasive, non-surgical treatment that requires tumor immobilization and image guidance in order to deliver a very precise, high-dose treatment. This trial will assess the use of SBRT to treat primary renal tumors by determining the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity. Subjects enrolled in this study will then be followed and evaluated for toxicity, serum chemistry, complete blood count, and urinalysis. In addition, they will undergo renal scans to assess the functionality of their renal tissue.There is a need for a non-invasive treatment modality in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients who are medically or technically inoperable or refuse surgery. The primary tumor in patients with RCC is generally managed surgically or with a non-surgical ablative modality, but there is significant toxicity and invasiveness associated with current surgical and percutaneous treatment modalities. Stereotactic radiotherapy was first developed to treat brain metastases and other intracranial tumors by giving a single high-dose treatment delivered with a precision of less than 1 mm. This treatment requires immobilization of the tumor and precise imaging to guide the treatment. The brain is particularly amenable to this approach since there is no internal brain motion, the skull is easily fixed in position, and excellent imaging is available. Recent developments in immobilization and image guidance now permit precise tumor targeting of extracranial sites, such as the liver and lung. Stereotactic radiotherapy used at extracranial sites is called stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Because of the great precision of SBRT, a high dose per treatment is possible. Early work evaluating SBRT in primary and metastatic liver and lung tumors has shown excellent results in tumor control and toxicity. Based on this, we propose expanding the use of this technique to RCC.

In this study, the investigators seek to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SBRT for the treatment of the primary tumor in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). One goal of this study is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of renal SBRT by determining the dose-volume relationship and toxicity for the kidney when high dose per fraction SBRT is used. In order to ensure proper immobilization and tumor localization, the investigators will use abdominal compression, 4D CT scanning at the time of simulation, and cone beam CT scanning at the time of treatment. The investigators propose to perform Tc-99m glucoheptonate renal scans before and after SBRT to assess renal tissue at the periphery of the lesion, as well as baseline and follow-up serum chemistry evaluation, creatinine, complete blood count, urinalysis, and creatinine clearance.";FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;Other;FALSE;;TRUE;TRUE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE

Patients eligible for treatment must be diagnosed with non-metastatic, biopsy-proven stage II-IVB oral cavity, stage III-IVB larynx and hypopharynx, or stage III-IVB HPV/p16 negative intermediate-high risk oropharynx head and neck cancer, and must be eligible and amenable to surgical resection.This study will be enrolled using a 3+3 model. Patients will receive one dose of neoadjuvant durvalumab 1500 mg approximately 3-6 weeks prior to standard of care surgery. It will be given concurrently with the first dose of radiation (RT). The starting RT dose level will be given as 6 Gy for 2 fractions (12 Gy total) every other day over approximately one week to sites of gross disease (Table 1) only to minimize exposure to normal tissue. If toxicity develops and surgery is delayed by more than 8 weeks (qualifying as a DLT), the radiation dose will be dropped per protocol for the next set of patients.

"Multi-Institutional Phase II Study of Weekly Docetaxel and Concurrent Radiotherapy for Laryngeal and Hypopharyngeal Cancer in the Group of Elderly and/or Patients With Medical IllnessRATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving docetaxel together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving docetaxel together with radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage II or stage III cancer of the larynx or hypopharynx.OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the objective response of the primary tumor in patients with stage II or III squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx or hypopharynx treated with docetaxel and radiotherapy.

Secondary

* Determine the local relapse-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the larynx-preservation survival of patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the protocol completion rate in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the adverse effects of this regimen in these patients.

"Randomized Phase III Clinical Trial of Adjuvant Radiation Versus Chemoradiation in Intermediate Risk, Stage I/IIA Cervical Cancer Treated With Initial Radical Hysterectomy and Pelvic Lymphadenectomy (NCT #01101451)This randomized phase III trial studies radiation therapy with chemotherapy to see how well they work compared to radiation therapy alone in treating patients with stage I-IIA cervical cancer who previously underwent surgery. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether giving radiation therapy together with chemotherapy is more effective than radiation therapy alone in treating patients with cervical cancer.PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To determine if post-operative adjuvant chemo-radiation therapy (CRT) can significantly improve recurrence-free survival (RFS) when compared to radiation therapy (RT) alone in stage I-IIA cervical cancer patients with intermediate-risk factors after treatment with radical hysterectomy.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine whether post-operative adjuvant CRT can improve overall survival (OS) when compared to RT alone in stage I-IIA cervical cancer patients with intermediate risk factors after treatment with radical hysterectomy.

II. To assess differences (across treatment arms) in incidence and severity of therapy attributed adverse events utilizing the active version of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).

III. To provide assessment of patient risk version (vs) benefit (positive study only).

QUALITY OF LIFE OBJECTIVE:

I. To determine whether post-operative adjuvant CRT improves the health-related quality-of-life (QOL) (compared to RT alone) as measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cervix (FACT-Cx) Trial Outcome Index (TOI) and produce favorable toxicity profiles (with particular focus on treatment related genitourinary, gastrointestinal, neurological, pain and sexual adverse events).

TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

I. To bank archival tumor tissue for research studies, including studies that evaluate the association between biomarkers, RFS, OS, and clinical-surgical-pathologic characteristics in patients randomized to post-operative adjuvant CRT compared to RT alone.

II. To bank deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from whole blood for research studies, including studies that evaluate associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and measures of clinical outcome, including RFS, OS, and adverse events in patients randomized to post-operative adjuvant CRT compared to RT alone.

"Comprehensive Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer: A Phase I/II StudyThis is a study that assesses the safety and efficacy of using stereotactic radiotherapy in conjunction with hormone therapy for patients with metastatic prostate cancer where there are a limited number of metastatic tumours.Patients will receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for a minimum of 1 year. After this, an intermittent hormone therapy approach will be taken, where ADT will not be restarted until the prostate specific antigen (PSA) reaches a minimum of 10-15 ng/mL. Lupron 30 mg IM will be delivered every 4 months when on ADT.

The prostate (if not previously treated) will be treated to a dose of 35-40 Gy in 5 fractions. All visible nodal metastases will be treated to a dose of 30-35 Gy in 5 fractions. It is very likely that nodal metastases will shrink significantly (often completely) with ADT. In this scenario, the involved nodal regions will be treated to a more modest dose of 25 Gy in 5 fractions (roughly equivalent to a dose of 46 Gy in 23 fractions assuming an Î±/Î² value of 1.4). Non-spine bone metastases will be treated to a dose of 30-40 Gy in 5 fractions. Metastases in the brain, spine, lung, liver, and adrenal will be treated according to established stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) policies at Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Centre. Comprehensive SRT should be delivered within 3 months of starting ADT.

During any ""off"" period of ADT (before the PSA rises above 10-15 ng/mL), comprehensive SRT can be repeated if there are new oligometastases that become visible. One month after initiation comprehensive SRT, patients will be contacted to assess for acute toxicities.

After completion of radiotherapy to all disease sites, patients will be followed every 3-4 months with PSA testing until the development of castrate resistant prostate cancer. At the same time points, late toxicity and quality of life will be collected for a minimum of 2 years. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest/abdo/pelvis +/- magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of previously irradiated body sites and bone scan will be performed whenever the PSA reaches â‰¥ 10 ng/mL (prior to re-starting androgen deprivation therapy during intermittent hormone therapy approach), or at a minimum frequency of once per year.";FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;;FALSE;;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;TRUE;8;TRUE;40;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;Other;FALSE;;TRUE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE
"Phase II Protocol of Proton Therapy for Partial Breast Irradiation in Early Stage Breast CancerThe purpose of this research study is to compare the effects (good and bad) on women and their cancer using proton radiation therapy.

This study is being done to see if proton radiation therapy will prove to be beneficial for women with early stage breast cancer. A clinical study is necessary to compare the results (good or bad) of proton radiation therapy.Current standard of care for early stage breast cancer is mastectomy or breast conserving therapy with whole breast irradiation following lumpectomy. However, studies of breast cancer recurrence have demonstrated the majority of tumors to recur in or adjacent to the original tumor site. The question has thus been raised as to whether radiation to the whole breast is necessary or justified. Limiting radiation to the area of the original tumor may reduce acute and long-term skin and organ toxicities while making radiation therapy more convenient and less expensive. Several clinical trials are underway comparing partial breast irradiation (PBI) to whole breast irradiation. Numerous centers are offering partial breast irradiation outside of clinical trials as well, despite the lack of long-term safety and efficacy data on PBI.

Available PBI methods include brachytherapy, in which catheters or balloons are surgically inserted to deliver radiation therapy to the lumpectomy cavity, and conventional external beam radiation therapy, or EBRT. External beam photon therapy is attractive for its non-invasive nature and ability to deliver a more homogenous dose distribution compared to brachytherapy, however it also delivers a greater radiation dose to surrounding normal breast tissue.Proton therapy has the capacity to provide the same advantages as photon EBRT while minimizing dose to normal surrounding tissue. Clinical data on PBI with protons is minimal, however, leaving many questions unanswered. The impetus behind this protocol is to address these gaps by further investigating the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of proton therapy for partial breast irradiation.";FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;Other;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE
"Adjuvant Chemotherapy With FOLFOX After Total Mesorectal Excision for Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer; an Open-label, Multicenter, Prospective, Randomized Phase 3 TrialThe introduction of total mesorectal excision (TME) and the progress of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has significantly reduced the risk of local recurrence in locally advanced rectal cancer. However, systemic recurrence rate is not being improved and that is considered as the cause of unsatisfactory overall survival of patients with rectal cancer. Relatively higher systemic relapse rate than local recurrence rate is probably due to the insufficient control of systemic micrometastasis during adjuvant chemotherapy. The efficacy of adjuvant combination cytotoxic chemotherapy after surgery in treatment of rectal cancer remains controversial. In addition, preoperative radiotherapy increases surgical complication such as anastomosis site leakage and radiotherapy itself worsen sexual and urinary function and bowel habit which result in aggravation of the quality of life. Furthermore the preoperative chemoradiotherapy upto 3 months not only extends treatment period but increases cost of care. To reduce the possibility of overtreatment, it is needed to confirm that the preoperative chemoradiotherapy is absolutely necessary to locally advanced rectal cancer patients with safe circumferential margin (CRM) resected curatively by standardized TME operation.

In this study, investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy after TME without preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer having spared CRM are not inferior to that of current standard treatment.";TRUE;TRUE;FALSE;;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;Other;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE
"A Phase I/II Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy in Patients Who Have Resectable Esophageal Cancer and Are Treated With Neoadjuvant Cisplatin, Irinotecan (CPT-11) ZD1839 (IRESSA), and Radiotherapy Followed by Surgical ResectionRATIONALE: Gefitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving gefitinib together with chemotherapy and radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of gefitinib when given together with cisplatin, irinotecan, and radiation therapy before surgery and to see how well they work in treating patients with esophageal cancer or gastroesophageal junction cancer that can be removed by surgery.OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Evaluate the pathologic response (complete and partial) in patients with resectable esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer treated with neoadjuvant gefitinib, cisplatin, irinotecan hydrochloride, and radiotherapy followed by surgical resection.

Secondary

* Assess the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.
* Evaluate objective tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the rate of complete resection in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine surgical morbidity and mortality in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

* Induction phase: Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily on days 1-14. Patients with stable or responding disease proceed to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.
* Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive gefitinib as in the induction phase beginning in week 4 and continuing through the last day of radiotherapy. Patients also receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 22, 29, 43, and 50 and undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 5 weeks (total of 25 doses).
* Surgery: Within 4-8 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, patients with stable or responding disease undergo an esophagectomy and lymph node dissection. Patients with a progressive or unresectable disease are removed from the study.

"Phase I/II Trial of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for the Treatment of Solitary Bone PlasmacytomaThis project aims to propose a new approach in the treatment of solitary plasmacytoma: hypofractionated irradiation alone with stereotactic technique that may contribute to the successful treatment of this disease.

This work aims to apply this new technique with the primary objective of reducing the progression-free survival for multiple myeloma of patients treated for solitary plasmacytoma, as well as quantify overall survival, local control, toxicities and quality of life in a phase I trial / II.Solitary plasmacytoma is a rare disease whose treatment has not evolved much in the last decades. The role of radiotherapy in the curative treatment of this entity was defined in a major publication in the 1980s and has since been proven to be the best practice in several other comparative trials, mostly retrospective. The radiotherapy dose of curative intent has also been described over the same period and remains unchanged to this day. Thus, local control, disease cure rate, and rate and progression time for multiple myeloma have been unaffected for almost 30 years.

Radiobiology of plasmacytoma cells is also not widely studied. The alpha / beta ratio, which defines the pattern of response of this disease to radiotherapy fractions and its response time, is also not well described. However, it is believed to be smaller in comparison to other hematological malignancies due to reports of cases of intrinsic radioresistance and late recurrence and reports of success with hypofractionated dose in isolated cases where stereotactic techniques were used such as base of skull and spine.";FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;PFS;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE

However, conventional EBRT is composed of many fractions (20-35 fractions). On the other hand, stereotactic ablative radiotherapy is a newly emerging treatment method to deliver a high dose of radiation to the target using a few fractions with a high precision within body.

"Metabolomic and BH3 Profiling of Esophageal Cancers: Identification of Novel Assessment Methods of Treatment Response for Precision TherapyBackground:

The number of patients with esophageal cancer keeps rising. For many patients, a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation is necessary to completely treat the disease. Usually, patients receive chemotherapy and radiation at the same time followed by surgery to remove the part of the esophagus with the tumor (Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT)). Researchers want to learn how to make this treatment more effective.

Objective:

To see if biopsies before treatment can show which patients will do the best with a combination of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.

Eligibility:

Adults at least 18 years old with esophageal adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma who should be treated with chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.

Design:

Patients will undergo standard testing that is routine for all patients with this disease. These tests include:

Medical history

Physical exam with activity and nutritional assessment

Standard lab tests

Imaging studies including a computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan and positron-emission tomography (PET) scan

Breathing test into a machine to measure size and function of lungs.

Biopsy for a small sample of tumor is removed by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD): A tube inserted into the mouth under anesthesia

Endoscopic ultrasound is performed in some but not all patients.

Patients will have nCRT at the clinic or with their local doctor.

In 6 -12 weeks after nCRT, patients will undergo surgery with:

1. A robotically-assisted, minimally-invasive esophagectomy
2. Or, a traditional, open approach.

After surgery, patients are usually in the hospital for 2 weeks and have a feeding tube for at least 2 weeks and potentially longer until they are eating enough to not lose weight.

Patients will return for follow-up visits with labs and CAT scans every 6 months for the first two years then every year afterwards.Background:

* The incidence of esophageal cancer continues to increase with an estimated 16,900 new cases and 15,700 deaths in 2016. Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is the dominant histology in the United States and accounts for the rising incidence; the incidence of esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) remains stable.
* Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed by esophagectomy is now a standard approach for locally advanced, operable esophageal cancer.
* A survival advantage compared to surgery alone was demonstrated in the phase III Chemo

Radiotherapy for Oesophageal cancer followed by Surgery Study (CROSS) trial.

* Patients who experience a pathological complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant therapy are most likely to have long-term survival.
* Presently, accurate assessment of pathologic response requires esophagectomy. Positron-emissions tomography (fludeoxyglucose (FDG-PET)) and endoscopic evaluation with biopsies fail to detect cancer in a significant percentage of patients with residual disease following neoadjuvant therapy.
* Currently there are no validated tissue or serologic biomarkers which can be used to guide surgical management of esophageal cancer patients based on response to nCRT.

Primary Objective:

-To determine whether a metabolomic signature in tumor, blood, or urine or whether BH3 profiling of pre-neoadjuvant tumor biopsies correlates with the outcome of pathological complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma.

Eligibility:

-Patients with locally-advanced, histologically confirmed EAC or ESCC who are candidates for nCRT and esophagectomy.

Design:

* Patients will receive standard of care nCRT either at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) or at referring institutions.
* Specimens of plasma, urine, and esophageal tumor with matched normal esophagus will be obtained before neoadjuvant therapy for metabolomic profiling and BH3 profiling.

Blood, urine, normal esophagus, and tumor (if present) will be obtained after neoadjuvant therapy.

* Patients will undergo an esophagectomy as a robotically-assisted, minimally-invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE) or a traditional open approach for contraindications to minimally-invasive approaches or based on institutional expertise.
* Analysis will be performed to determine if pathological complete response (pCR) after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) correlates with pretreatment metabolomic signatures or BH3 profiling in tumor, blood or urine.
* Patients with EAC and ESCC will be evaluated independently.
* The accrual ceiling will be set to 120 patients for the entire study - 80 patients for EAC and 40 patients for ESCC to allow for unevaluable patients. The accrual is expected to be completed in 4 years.";FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;120;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;TRUE;120;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;Other;FALSE;;TRUE;TRUE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE

3-AP may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. 3-AP may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving 3-AP together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the maximal tolerable dose (MTD) of 3-AP administered in combination with radiation therapy (XRT) in patients with locally advanced pancreatic carcinomas.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To document the therapeutic response of this combination in patients with locally advanced pancreatic carcinomas.

II. To establish radiographic correlates using secretin stimulated magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

III. To measure deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)before and after treatment at specified times and try to correlate findings to activity and toxicity of triapine.

"A Phase III Randomized Study of Pretherapeutic Para-aortic Lymphadenectomy in Women With Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer Dispositioned to Definitive ChemoradiotherapyThe goal of this clinical research study is to learn if a surgical procedure called an extraperitoneal laparoscopic lymphadenectomy followed by chemotherapy and tailored radiation therapy can help to control the disease for a longer time than standard-of-care chemotherapy and whole pelvic radiation therapy.You will have a positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan to check the status of the disease. For up to 6 hours before the PET/CT scan, you must not eat or drink anything except water. A small tube will be placed in your arm, and you will receive an injection of a very small amount of a mildly radioactive sugar material into your bloodstream. The radioactive nature of this injected material allows the scanner to ""see"" it in certain places in your body. After the injection, you will need to rest quietly until it is time for the scan. The amount of rest time may vary, but be prepared to wait for between 45 and 90 minutes. During the scan, you will lie flat on your back on a table. The scan itself may last up to 1 hour.

The study doctor will discuss the test results with you. If the test shows that you are not eligible to take part in the study, you will not be enrolled. Other treatment options will be discussed with you.

If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. You have an equal chance of being assigned to either group.

If you are in Group 1, you will have an extraperitoneal laparoscopic lymphadenectomy followed by chemoradiation therapy.

If you are in Group 2, you will receive standard-of-care chemoradiation therapy only.

Study Procedure and Visits:

If you are in Group 1, you will have an extraperitoneal laparoscopic lymphadenectomy, a procedure where surgeons remove and examine the lymph nodes in the abdomen. The study doctor will explain the risks for this procedure to you and you will sign a separate surgical consent form. This procedure will be performed 7-10 days before chemoradiation treatment begins.

During the laparoscopy procedure, a telescope-like instrument with a small camera on the end (a laparoscope) will be placed through a small cut in the abdomen. Three (3) other small cuts will be made to place instruments that may be needed to complete the surgery. Before the laparoscope is inserted, carbon dioxide gas will be pumped into your abdomen making it easier for the surgeon to see. The laparoscope will then be placed through the small cut. Using a TV monitor, the surgeon will use the camera to find the lymph nodes in the abdomen and then remove them. After the procedure is finished, the carbon dioxide gas will be removed and you will be taken to the recovery room.

If these lymph nodes contain cancer, the area of the body treated with radiation can be ""extended"" to treat new areas. Future treatment options will be based on what is found. This means that radiation will be used to treat both the lymph nodes in the abdomen and the standard area of radiation in the pelvis.

Participants in both groups will then have radiation for 5 days in a row for 5 to 5Â½ weeks. If the study doctor thinks it is needed and you agree, you will have extra radiation treatments.

Participants in both groups will receive cisplatin chemotherapy by vein over about 2 hours, 1 time every week for about 6 weeks. In most cases, treatment is given on Mondays (Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36).

After 5 to 5Â½ weeks of chemotherapy and radiation treatment, participants in both groups will receive implants in the pelvis for about 48 hours. You will remain in the hospital at this time. The study doctor will explain the risks for this procedure to you and you will sign a separate surgical consent form.

Length of Study:

You may be on study for up to 5 years. Your participation on the study will be over after you have completed radiation treatment and the follow-up visits described below. You may be taken off study if intolerable side effects occur or if you are unable to follow study directions.

Long-Term Follow-Up:

The following tests and procedures will be performed:

* You will have a PET scan to check the status of the disease 3 months after you complete radiation treatment.
* You have a CT scan to check the status of the disease every 6 months for the next 3 years after that.

You will visit the clinic for a physical exam:

* Every 3 months for the first 2 years
* Every 6 months for the next 3 years, and
* One (1) time each year after that, up to 5 years

This is an investigational study. The extraperitoneal laparoscopic lymphadenectomy is considered investigational. Chemoradiation treatment is FDA approved for the treatment of cervical cancer.

"A Phase II Trial of Weekly Gemcitabine Hydrochloride and Bevacizumab in Combination With Abdominal Radiation Therapy in Patients With Localized Pancreatic CancerRATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the tumor growth by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Gemcitabine and bevacizumab may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving gemcitabine together with bevacizumab and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving gemcitabine together with bevacizumab and abdominal radiation therapy works in treating patients with localized pancreatic cancer.OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the objective response rate in patients treated with concurrent bevacizumab, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and abdominal radiotherapy.

Secondary

* Determine the quantitative toxicity associated with the delivery of this regimen in these patients.
* Determine the 1-year and median survival of patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the patterns of recurrence in the entire population of patients treated with this regimen and in the subgroup that is resected for cure.
* Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.
* Evaluate the surgical experience of patients who undergo surgical resection after completion of protocol-directed therapy.
* Evaluate the toxicity associated with surgical resection in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 of courses 1 and 3 and on days 1, 8, and 15 of course 2. Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15 of course 1, on days 8 and 22 of course 2, and on day 8 of course 3. Treatment repeats every 3-4 weeks for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning on day 1 of the second course of chemotherapy, patients undergo concurrent abdominal radiotherapy once daily, five days a week, for 3 weeks.

Patients are evaluated at week 10. Patients whose disease deemed resectable after study treatment undergo standard pancreatic resection at least 6 weeks after completion of bevacizumab. Patients who remain unresectable and have not progressed after completion of chemoradiotherapy may begin maintenance therapy comprising gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment with gemcitabine hydrochloride and bevacizumab repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 10 years.

Partial Breast Re-irradiation in Women with Locally Recurrent Breast Cancer Previously Treated with Conservative Surgery and Whole Breast Irradiation: a Prospective Phase II Clinical StudyA prospective study of partial breast re-irradiation in patients with local recurrence of breast cancerBreast cancer is the leading type of cancer in women worldwide. Although advances in treatment have led to an overall reduction in breast cancer mortality, survivors continue to have an ongoing risk of disease recurrence. For women who experience breast recurrence, mastectomy has historically been the only treatment approach offered. However, it has been associated with negative health outcomes, including reduced quality of life, depression and anxiety, and impaired sexual functioning. As a result, there is increasing interest to identify treatment options that include breast preservation.

"Phase II Study of SIB-IMRT in Combination With 5-FU and Mitomycin-C Among Patients With Locally Advanced Anal Canal Cancer: Efficacy, Safety and Quality of LifeAnal canal carcinoma (ACC) represents 1.2% of digestive cancers. Its incidence is increasing. As epidermoid ACC (95% of ACC) are particularly sensitive to radio and chemotherapy, concomitant radio-chemotherapy is the standard treatment of locally advanced ACC, with proven efficacy on locoregional control, anal sphincter preservation, progression-free survival and complete response rate higher than 80%.

Nevertheless, conventional radiotherapy frequently induces significant non-haematological toxicities requiring treatment interruptions. Thus, treatment usually includes a chemotherapy (5-Fluorouracil and Mitomycine-C) and 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy followed by a planned 1-week (or more) interruption and a boost, for a total 54-60 Gy radiation dose over 9 weeks.

Considering the numerous anatomic pelvic structures, ACC has become a localisation of interest for Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) associated with less toxicity.

However, IMRT induces gradeâ‰¥3 cutaneous toxicities requiring irradiation breaks. Dose escalade did not show its interest: 60 Grays remains the standard.

Assuming the deleterious effect of increased overall treatment time on local control and survival in head-and-neck and cervical cancers and the epidermoid histology of ACC, the benefit of no irradiation break on ACC tumour control is of interest.

IMRT offers the possibility to deliver different doses to different target volumes simultaneously by altered fractionation schedule like SIB-IMRT (simultaneously integrated boost-IMRT). Several SIB-IMRT schedules have been retrospectively evaluated. Similar results were observed with moderate doses and schedules delivering higher doses with short interruptions.

"Short-course Radiotherapy Versus Chemoradiotherapy, Followed by Consolidation Chemotherapy, and Selective Organ Preservation for MRI-defined Intermediate and High-risk Rectal Cancer PatientsThe hereby proposed ACO/ARO/AIO-18.1 randomized trial aims to directly compare the newly established TNT concepts applying either short-course RT according to RAPIDO, or CRT according to CAO/ARO/AIO-04/-12, both followed by consolidation chemotherapy, and surgery or a watch\&wait (W\&W) approach for patients with clinical complete response (cCR).

The ACO/ARO/AIO-18.1 study incorporates several novel and innovative aspects to further optimize multimodal rectal cancer treatment, partly established by our preceding CAO/ARO/AIO-04 and CAO/ARO/AIO-12 randomized trials: (1) patient selection is based on strict, quality controlled MRI features of intermediate and high-risk characteristics (and, thus, complementary to our ACO/ARO/AIO-18.2 trial in ""low-risk"" rectal cancer), (2) the CRT regimens incorporates 5-FU/oxaliplatin with doses and intensities shown to be effective and well-tolerated without compromising treatment compliance in CAO/ARO/AIO-04, (3) the sequence of CRT, CT, and surgery/W\&W adopts the TNT approach as established by our CAO/ARO/AIO-12 and OPRA trial, (4) surgical stratification allows for W\&W management for strictly selected patients with clinical complete response (cCR). Thus, we hypothesize that TNT with 5-FU/oxaliplatin-CRT followed by consolidation chemotherapy may increase organ preservation while maintaining DFS as compared to RAPIDO-like short-course RT followed by consolidation chemotherapy.The primary endpoint of this trial, organ preservation, is defined as follows: survival with rectum intact, no major surgery, no stoma. Accordingly, the primary endpoint, organ preservation, will not be reached if any of the following occurs: (1) death, (2) any major surgery other than local excision (R0) performed after randomization, during TNT, at re-staging scheduled 22-24 weeks after start of TNT due to clinical non-cCR, or for any locoregional regrowth after initial cCR requiring salvage-TME, (3) any locoregional regrowth not amenable to salvage surgery, or (4) any stoma (non-re-converted protective stoma within 6 months after completion of TNT, or any stoma needed for toxicity or poor function), whichever occurs first. We hypothesized that the 3-year organ preservation rate will improve from 30% in the control arm to 40% in the investigational arm (hazard ratio of 0.76).

"Carboplatin-Paclitaxel Induction Chemotherapy and ABT-888 (Veliparib) - a Phase 1/Randomized Phase 2 Study in Patients With Locoregionally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and NeckThis partially randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given together with combination chemotherapy and to see how well they work in treating patients with stage IV head and neck cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective when given with or without veliparib in treating head and neck cancer.PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase II dose, dose limiting toxicity (DLT), and safety of ABT-888 (veliparib) with carboplatin and paclitaxel induction chemotherapy in locoregionally advanced head and neck (LAHNC) patients. (Phase I) II. Compare magnitude of tumor shrinkage (response) following 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy with and without ABT-888 in LAHNC. (Phase II)

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Compare progression-free (PFS), disease-specific (DSS), and overall survival (OS) in subjects treated with or without ABT-888. (Phase II)

OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of veliparib followed by a phase II study.

PHASE I: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7, paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then continue on to concomitant chemoradiotherapy.

PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

ARM I: Patients receive veliparib, paclitaxel, and carboplatin as in Phase I. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 10 days from completion of course 2, patients begin concomitant chemoradiotherapy.

ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID on days 1-7. Patients also receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as in Phase I.

"Evaluation of the Irinotecan/Bevacizumab Association as Neo-adjuvant and Adjuvant Treatment of Chemoradiation With Temozolomide for Naive Unresectable Glioblastoma. Phase II Randomized Study With Comparison to Chemoradiation With TemozolomideTreatment of glioblastoma (GBM) is based on surgery when possible, and chemoradiation with temozolomide, which became a standard since the EORTC study (Stupp, 2005). However, the prognosis of unresectable GBM remains poor despite chemoradiation with an estimated 10 month median survival, in the range of the comparable patients in the RPA class V from the EORTC study (Miramanoff, 2006).

Vredenburgh et al. from the Duke University (Durham, NC) reported at ASCO 2006 (fully published in J Clin Oncol, 2007) a 57 % unexpected response rate using a bevacizumab/irinotecan schedule in patients with relapsed GBM or grade 3 astrocytomas. This unusual high response rate, sometimes with major and sustained responses, was confirmed by a cooperative french study of ANOCEF (Guiu et al., 2008). Such a major improvement of treatment effectiveness lead ANOCEF, which federates most of the active neuro-oncology teams in France, to propose a neo-adjuvant and adjuvant bevacizumab-based chemotherapy framing a standard temozolomide-based chemoradiation with the aim to improve the prognosis of unresectable GBM.

The bevacizumab/temozolomide combination as neo-adjuvant is presently being evaluated by the Duke University. We believe that an ambitious comparison of the bevacizumab/irinotecan-schedule with the ''standard'' temozolomide-based chemoradiation is a fascinating challenge to improve the treatment of this awful disease.

"SABR-CaRe: A Phase II Randomized Trial of Pre-Operative Stereotactic Ablative Radiation Therapy (SABR) With and Without Caloric Restriction for Early Stage Breast CancerThis phase II trial studies the effect of calorie reduction while undergoing stereotactic ablative radiation therapy in treating patients with breast cancer. Stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (sABR) is a highly focused radiation treatment that gives an intense dose of radiation concentrated on a tumor, while limiting the dose to the surrounding organ. Giving SABR before surgery may make the tumor smaller. Adding dietary restrictions in combination with radiation therapy may help increase local control and decrease the spread of the cancer to other places in the body. The purpose of this trial is to identify if there is a decrease in tumor tissue in patients undergoing caloric restriction during pre-operative SABR, compared to patients undergoing pre-operative SABR alone.PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To detect a decrease in cellularity of the tumor in participants undergoing caloric restriction during pre-operative SABR as compared to participants undergoing SABR alone.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Change in miR-21 as defined by baseline and post radiation levels. II. Investigate measurable changes of patient and tumor characteristics from the combination of SABR and caloric restriction (CR) versus SABR alone to inform future trials.

III. To describe pathologic complete response (pCR) rates as defined by no residual carcinoma or no residual invasive carcinoma, but ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) may be present, in each arm as well as by subtype.

IV. To assess response of each treatment arm using contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) and correlate with pathologic response.

V. To describe short term surgical outcomes including: sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification rate, positive margins requiring return to the operative room for re-excision, and post-operative complications (infection, delayed wound healing, seroma requiring aspiration).

VI. To measure patient reported health-related outcomes and satisfaction with outcome.

VII. To compare patient reported cosmesis to physician reported cosmesis scores, where cosmesis is rated as excellent, good, fair or poor.

VIII. To compare pCR rates between women randomized to SABR alone to women randomized to SABR + CR who are at least 80% adherent to the CR intervention.

IX. To compare pCR rates between women randomized to SABR alone who do not deviate by more than 10% from their baseline caloric intake to women randomized to SABR + CR who are at least 80% adherent to the CR intervention.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. Tissue: To determine the downstream molecular effects of diet related to miR-21 such as FAS/FASL, PD-1, LAG3 and STAT3 expression.

II. Microbiome: Compare baseline to post-SABR microbiome species separately for each trial arm.

III. Serum: Determine if anti-tumor immunity has increased with increased CD8 and decreased Treg in tumor. Compare proteomic profiles.

"Single Fraction High Dose Rate (HDR) Brachytherapy Plus Hypofractionated External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT) for Low-risk Prostate Cancer: Phase II TrialThe hypofractionated external radiation (EBRT) is a technique that radiation dose delivery using higher daily fractions than those used routinely. In this way can cause more damage tumor, especially in tissues that have a slower proliferation rate, as in the case of prostate cancer. Furthermore, achieves a reduction in total treatment time and probably a lesser chance of development of collateral in tissues of high multiplication rate as the lining of the rectum and bladder effects.

With brachytherapy boost for high dose rate is achieved by administering a more intense dose on the tumor and lower the sound around the region to be treated tissues, improving the therapeutic window.

Treatment with retracted and fully ambulatory time, has potential benefit as early patient return to usual activities and optimizing the flow of patients who require treatment with radiotherapy. This prospective study aims to assess the results and the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen retracted.OBJECTIVE The primary objective is to analyze the toxicity profile, via a phase II study of treatment of patients with low risk prostate cancer with the association of hypo fractionated EBRT and HDR brachytherapy boost.

"A Prospective Study Implementing MRI Based Treatment Planning for Clinical Target Volume Definition and Immobilization in Post-Prostatectomy Radiation TreatmentThis is a prospective clinical trial examining the use of MRI to measure internal organ motion and any resulting changes in the target volume (shape and location) during a course of post-operative radiation therapy for prostate cancer. The goal is to better understand and characterize these physiologic variations so that they can be accounted for during the treatment planning process. The ultimate longer-term clinical goal here is to provide a form of adaptive radiation therapy in the future, such that if major changes are seen over an 8-week course of radiation therapy in our study. This may argue for hypofractionating those patients who are most likely to have major shifts over time.PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the use of MRI in delineating clinical target volumes, as well as endorectal balloon target immobilization in patients treated with radiation following radical prostatectomy.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

II. Trends over time in CTV, bladder and rectum volumes and percent change from baseline at each time point. III. Frequency of events in which the CTV falls outside the PTV. IV. Proportion of the total CTV which falls outside the PTV at each event. V. Trends over time in dose-volume exposures for bladder and rectum.

"Phase III Multicentric Trial Comparing Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) Versus Standard or Hypofractionated Whole Breast Irradiation in Low Risk of Local Recurrence of Breast CancerThe standard treatment for localized breast cancer is based on conservative surgery (when possible) followed by radiation therapy (RT) delivered to the whole breast. The recommended total RT dose is 45 to 50 Gy delivered in 4.5 to 5 weeks followed by a 10 to 16 Gy boost to the tumor bed for 1 to 1.5 weeks. The rationale for the development of APBI was based on the difficulty for many patients to reach RT centers to receive standard whole breast irradiation (WBI) after conservative surgery. APBI offers decreased overall treatment time and several theoretical advantages over WBI, including a decrease in dose delivered to uninvolved portions of the breast and adjacent organs. If equivalence between the two treatments can be shown, then APBI will be considered as a historic evolution in breast cancer management.

In this phase III trial, designed in postmenopausal women \>50 years of age, the objective is to compare the effectiveness and safety of APBI compared with whole breast irradiation. This study is also designed to ensure high quality criteria for surgery, pathology and RT techniques in the 3 arms and will allow to provide data on economics and costs.Following breast conservative surgery, patients will be stratified according to the following prognostic factors using a minimisation technique: age (\<70 vs â‰¥70), HER2 status (HER2+ vs HER2-), hormonal receptor status (RH+ vs RH-) and lymph node invasion (pN0 vs pN0i+).

Patients will be allocated to receive either standard treatment, hypofractionated treatment or APBI.

Radiation therapy should be started between 4 and 12 weeks after the last surgery.

Patients treated with standard whole breast irradiation will receive a total dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions, 2 Gy per day, 5 days a week. The boost of 16 Gy will be delivered in 8 fractions for all patients after completion of the 50 Gy, without interruption. All patients will receive one fraction per day, 5 fractions a week.

Patients treated with hypofractionated irradiation will receive a total dose of either 40 Gy (in 15 fractions, 2.66 Gy per day) or 42.5 Gy (in 16 fractions, 2.65 Gy per day) 5 days a week.

Patients treated with APBI will receive a total dose of 40 Gy in 10 fractions, delivered twice a day over a time period of 5-7 days. Each daily dose must be separated by 6 hours.

Patients will be followed at 3 and 6 month after the last dose of irradiation, at 12 months after the date of last surgery and then on a yearly basis during 10 years.";FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;;TRUE;120;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;TRUE;2;TRUE;66;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;Other;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE
"Phase I/II Study of the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) Combined With Concurrent and Adjuvant Avelumab for Definitive Management of Early Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)The purpose of the study is to determine whether avelumab has an effect on cancer and body in combination with SBRT, a standard treatment for early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Avelumab is considered experimental because it is not approved by the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of cancer. It is a type of drug called a monoclonal antibody (a type of protein). Monoclonal antibodies are made to recognize, target and bind to specific proteins on the cells that make up your tissues. Avelumab is designed to block the interaction between PD-1, a known immune checkpoint, and PD-L1. By blocking this interaction, the immune system may be stimulated, allowing it to more effectively recognize and attack the cancer.

Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is a type of radiation that uses precise targeting to deliver a high dose of radiation to the tumor over a short period of time. A positioning cushion such as Vac-lok will be used during radiation treatment that is custom made. This custom mold forms to the contours of the subjects body to allow for proper positioning comfort and stability.This is a single arm open label Phase I/II study that will consist of two parts. In Phase I, investigators will assess the safety and tolerability of SBRT combined with Avelumab. In Phase II, investigators will determine whether SBRT combined with Avelumab improves relapse free survival. Subjects with Stage I NSCLC who are not undergoing surgical resection will be candidates for enrollment. Subjects will receive definitive stereotactic body radiation (SBRT) in 4-5 fractions combined with concurrent and adjuvant Avelumab at 10mg/kg for a total of 6 cycles. Subjects will be evaluated for safety as measured by the occurrence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and laboratory abnormalities.

"Phase III Trial of Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) or Hippocampal-Avoidant Whole Brain Radiotherapy (HA-WBRT) for Distant Brain Relapse With Brain Metastasis Velocity &gt;/= 4 Brain Metastases/YearThis phase III trial compares the effect of adding whole brain radiotherapy with hippocampal avoidance and memantine versus stereotactic radiosurgery alone in treating patients with cancer that has spread to the brain and come back in other areas of the brain after earlier stereotactic radiosurgery. Hippocampus avoidance during whole-brain radiation therapy decreases the amount of radiation that is delivered to the hippocampus, which is a brain structure that is important for memory. The medicine memantine is also often given with whole brain radiation therapy because it may decrease the risk of side effects of radiation on neurocognitive function (including thinking and memory). Stereotactic radiosurgery delivers a high dose of radiation only to the small areas of cancer in the brain and avoids the surrounding normal brain tissue. Adding whole brain radiotherapy with hippocampal avoidance and memantine may be effective in reducing the size of the cancer or keeping the cancer the same size when it has spread to the brain and/or come back in other areas of the brain compared to stereotactic radiosurgery.PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To determine if hippocampal-avoidant plus whole brain radiotherapy (HA-WBRT) in patients with distant brain failure with brain metastasis velocity \>= 4 new brain metastases/year prolongs time to neurologic death as compared to stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine if HA-WBRT in patients with distant brain failure with brain metastasis velocity \>= 4 new brain metastases/year prolongs overall survival as compared to SRS.

II. To evaluate if HA-WBRT in patients with distant brain failure with brain metastasis velocity \>= 4 new brain metastases/year prolongs intracranial progression-free survival as compared to SRS.

III. To evaluate if HA-WBRT in patients with distant brain failure with brain metastasis velocity \>= 4 new brain metastases/year improves brain metastasis velocity at subsequent relapse as compared to SRS.

IV. To assess perceived difficulties in cognitive abilities, symptom burden and health status after HA-WBRT, as compared to SRS, in patients with distant brain failure with brain metastasis velocity \>= 4 new brain metastases/year.

V. To compare neurocognitive function outcomes following HA-WBRT, as compared to SRS, in patients with distant brain failure with brain metastasis velocity \>= 4 new brain metastases/year.

VI. To tabulate and descriptively compare the adverse events associated with the interventions.

VII. To tabulate and descriptively compare the number of salvage procedures used to manage recurrent intracranial disease following the interventions.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. To collect serum, plasma, and whole blood for translational research analyses.

II. To collect baseline and all follow-up magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for hippocampal volume, memory center substructures, axial T2 volumes, and quantitative texture analysis.

III. To collect baseline and follow-up MR imaging to extract whole brain volume, white matter volume and volume of metastatic disease to correlate with cognitive change at 4 months.

IV. To evaluate dose-volume histogram parameters to correlate with radiation toxicity.

V. To assess in patients receiving immunotherapy or targeted therapy, if HA-WBRT in patients with distant brain failure with brain metastasis velocity \>= 4 new brain metastases/year at time improves brain metastasis velocity and/or overall survival at subsequent relapse as compared to SRS.

In the present study, 5 daily fractions of 6 Gray will be given over two weeks. Stereotactic body radiation therapy will be given with the Cyberknife system. This treatment technique allows to give a higher dose to the tumor as compared to conventional external beam radiation while lowering the dose to the normal tissues around. This treatment system is also capable of following the motion that the pancreas assumes during respiration as well as during treatment. This enables us to reduce the margin of security and further reduce dose to surrounding normal tissue.

"Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial for no Inferiority With Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy and Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery (TEM) Versus Total Mesorectal Excision in T2-T3s N0, M0 Rectal CancerThe standard treatment of rectal adenocarcinoma is total mesorectal excision (TME). The technique involves a low anterior rectal or colo-anal resection, very often associated with a protective stoma or abdominal-perineal resection with permanent colostomy. Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) allows access to tumors up to 20 cm from the anal margin, with minimal postoperative morbidity and mortality. Recent studies of T1 rectal adenocarcinomas consider TEM to be the technique of choice. However the treatment of T2 rectal cancers remains controversial. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy (CT/RT) has achieved a concomitant reduction in local recurrence and an increase in survival.

Hypothesis: Patients with rectal adenocarcinoma less than 10 cm from the anal margin and up to 4 cm in size, staged after endorectal ultrasound and MRI as T2 or superficial T3 N0-M0-N0-M0, who underwent surgery after preoperative local chemoradiotherapy (TEM), achieve effective results in terms of local recurrence similar to radical surgery (TME).

OBJECTIVES:

Primary: To compare the results of local recurrence at 2 years in patients treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy and TEM and in patients treated with conventional radical surgery (TME).

Secondary: To analyse the 3-year survival results in patients treated with CT/RT.

"HNSALV Trial: Combining Immunotherapy With Salvage Surgery and IORT for Treatment of Persistent/Recurrent Head and Neck CancersThis phase I trial is to find out the possible side effects of pembrolizumab and radiation therapy before and during surgery in treating patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer that remains despite treatment (persistent) or has come back (recurrent). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays or protons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving pembrolizumab and radiation therapy before and during surgery may kill more tumor cells.PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To evaluate the clinical efficacy, measured as a locoregional control rate (LCR) and progression-free survival (PFS), of immunotherapy and preoperative radiation combined with intra-operative radiation in patients with recurrent or persistent HNSCC.

II. To evaluate the pre-operative radiation dose effect (0 Gy, 2 Gy X 2, 8 Gy X 2) on anti-tumor immune response in the setting of immunotherapy in patients with recurrent or persistent HNSCC.

III. To evaluate the radiation dose effect (0 Gy, 2 Gy X 2, 8 Gy X 2) on the expression of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) exonuclease Trex1.

IV. To compare the overall survival (OS) of pembrolizumab and pre and post-operative external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) plus intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) in subjects with recurrent or persistent HNSCC.

V. To assess the overall safety and tolerability of pre-operative pembrolizumab and pre-operative EBRT and IORT plus post-operative pembrolizumab versus pre-operative pembrolizumab plus IORT and post-operative pembrolizumab in subjects with with recurrent or persistent HNSCC.

"A Prospective Phase II Study of Inguinal Node Sparing Radiotherapy For Patients With Early Stage Anal Cancer (INSPIRE)The purpose of this study is to see whether avoiding preventative radiation to the groin in patients with normal sentinel node biopsy and PET-CT, is at least as effective treating cancer as giving preventative radiation to the groin for patients with anal canal cancer.

The investigators also want to know if avoiding radiation to the groin will cause fewer side effects and better quality of lifeRadiotherapy (RT) with concurrent 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin-C (5FU/MMC) combination is the treatment of choice for non-metastatic locally advanced anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC). While, locally advanced AC treatment involves elective inguinal lymph node irradiation along with concurrent chemotherapy with significant improvement of locoregional control and colostomy free survival, many oncologists believe that routine, elective irradiation of bilateral inguinal areas of patients with limited disease (T1-T3) without lymph node involvement may be overtreatment and the larger radiation target that includes entire pelvis and bilateral inguinal region causes significant acute and late toxicities.

SLNB is the standard procedure currently used for breast cancer staging. The most significant observation was that when the SLN is negative, no further ALND or adjuvant axillary radiation is need for those patients. The SLNB had shown a better diagnostic accuracy (31% vs.25%) and higher sensitivity (85% vs.75%) than FDG-PET imaging to detect inguinal lymph node metastasis. Given better diagnostic accuracy and high sensitivity of SLNB, this technique could be used precisely to define target population who could be spared of prophylactic inguinal irradiation.

The investigators hypothesize that patients with early clinical stage node negative anal cancer (T1-T3N0) have low risk of subclinical inguinal lymph node involvement that can be detected by a combination of PET imaging and SLNB. Hence, any early stage AC patients with node negative disease confirmed by PET imaging and SLNB have relatively low risk of nodal failure and so inguinal radiation could be avoided. This approach would limit over treatment of early stage patients, reduce acute and late toxicities. This will be tested in a phase II study with close follow up of study patients so that inguinal relapse if any occur will be salvaged successfully.

"NASSIST (Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation +/- Immunotherapy Before Surgery for Superior Sulcus Tumors): A Randomized Phase II Trial of Trimodality +/- Atezolizumab in Resectable Superior Sulcus Non-Small Cell Lung CancerThis phase II trial tests the effect of atezolizumab given with usual chemotherapy during radiation therapy in treating patients with superior sulcus non-small cell lung cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin, carboplatin, etoposide, paclitaxel and pemetrexed, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy beams to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.

"A Phase I Study of Nivolumab and Intratumoral BO 112 for Resectable Soft Tissue SarcomaThis phase I trial studies the side effects of BO-112 when given together with nivolumab before surgery in treating patients with soft tissue sarcoma that can be removed by surgery (resectable). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Immunotherapy with BO-112, may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving nivolumab and BO-112 before surgery may work better in treating patients with soft tissue sarcoma compared to nivolumab alone.PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To determine the safety and tolerability of integrating BO-112, and BO-112 with nivolumab in soft tissue sarcoma patients undergoing preoperative radiotherapy.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the change in T cell infiltration at surgical resection from baseline as measured by immunohistochemistry.

II. Assess treatment effect (necrosis score) of BO-112 and BO-112 in combination with nivolumab in soft tissue sarcoma patients receiving preoperative hypofractionated radiotherapy, compared to patients treated on a recently completed phase 2 study of preoperative hypofractionated radiotherapy alone.

III. Evaluate the 2-year rate of local and distant metastasis of BO-112 and BO-112 in combination with nivolumab in patients with localized resectable soft tissue sarcoma receiving preoperative hypofractionated radiotherapy, as compared to historical patients receiving preoperative radiotherapy alone.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. Evaluate the dynamics of the intratumoral T cell phenotype. II. Assess the capacity to grow ex vivo tumor infiltrating lymphocytes from patients treated with BO-112 and BO-112 in combination with nivolumab.

III. Analyze changes in T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) between baseline, post-treatment, and ex vivo cultured tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) samples.

IV. For patients with disease burden outside of the resected lesion, assess imaging response to treatment using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

"Phase II Trial Of Induction Chemotherapy Followed By Attenuated Chemoradiotherapy For Locally Advanced Head And Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Associated With Human Papillomavirus (HPV)This phase II trial studies how well paclitaxel and carboplatin before radiation therapy with paclitaxel works in treating human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive patients with stage III-IV oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Giving paclitaxel and carboplatin before radiation therapy with paclitaxel may kill more tumor cells.PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the progression-free survival at 2 years in patients with HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who receive induction chemotherapy followed by dose de-intensified chemoradiotherapy.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the overall survival and local-regional control for patients with HPV-positive HNSCC who receive induction chemotherapy and dose de-intensified chemoradiotherapy.

II. To determine the incidence of acute grade 3+ mucosal and esophageal toxicity associated with attenuated concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with HPV-positive HNSCC.

III. To determine the incidence of late toxicity in patients with HPV-positive HNSCC who receive the dose de-intensified chemoradiotherapy.

IV. To estimate the incidence of all toxicity (hematologic and non-hematologic) associated with protocol treatment for all patients on trial.

V. To estimate the response rate of HPV-positive to induction chemotherapy using carboplatin and paclitaxel.

VI. To determine the effect of reduced radiation dose on short-term and long-term quality of life among patients treated by chemoradiotherapy.

Phase II Randomized Trial of Adjuvant XELOX Chemotherapy and XELOX With Concurrent Capecitabine and Radiotherapy for Gastric Adenocarcinoma With D2 DissectionThe objective of the trial is to compare disease-free survival between adjuvant XELOX alone vs XELOX with concurrent capecitabine and radiotherapy in curatively resected gastric cancer patients with D2 dissection.Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignancies in China. Complete surgical resection is the only potentially curative therapy available to patients with gastric cancer. However, the overall survival results remain unsatisfactory. The main factor accounting for high mortality rate is the relapse after surgical resection. During the past few decades, the principle of combined modality treatment has been developed and applied in gastric cancer. Radiation therapy plus concurrent chemotherapy had demonstrated to be able to achieve a significant improvement in overall and disease-free survival according to Intergroup Trial 0116/Southwest Oncology Group 9008. Nevertheless, the result from Intergroup Trial 0116 study had been challenged by the fact that the surgical treatment applied in the trial was gastrectomy with limited lymph node dissection (D0 or D1) in 90% of cases. Therefore, it is debatable whether adjuvant chemoradiation therapy can confer survival benefit in patients with extensive lymph node dissection. In ARTIST study, the addition of concurrent capecitabine and radiotherapy to capecitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy did not significantly reduce recurrence after curative resection and D2 lymph node dissection in gastric cancer. In subgroup analysis of patients with positive pathologic lymphnodes, there was a statistically significant prolongation in disease-free survival in the concurrent treatment arm when compared with the chemotherapy alone arm. Furthermore, CLASSIC study showed that XELOX (oxaliplatin/capecitabine) combination given as adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II or III patients after D2 surgery could achieve a significant survival benefit. The standard treatment modality in gastric cancer after D2 dissection is still disputable. Thus, the assessment of the effect of adjuvant sequence chemoradiotherapy in D2 resected gastric cancer is essential.;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;DFS;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE

"A Phase II Pilot Study of Avelumab in Combination With Hypofractionated Radiotherapy in Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple MyelomaBackground:

Multiple myeloma is a cancer that forms from plasma cells which normally produce important immune response antibodies. It cannot be cured. Researchers hope the combination of radiation combined with the drug avelumab causes the immune system to kill myeloma cells more effectively.

Objective:

To see if avelumab given with radiation treatment helps treat multiple myeloma. Also to see if giving the treatments together is safe.

Eligibility:

People ages 18 and older with multiple myeloma that has come back after treatment and has spread to other parts of the body

Design:

Participants will be screened with:

Medical history

Physical exam

Blood, urine, and heart tests

Possible tumor biopsy

Bone marrow testing: A needle will be stuck into the participants hipbone to take out a small amount of marrow.

Positron emission tomography (PET)/Computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body.

Participants will get avelumab through an intravenous (IV). An IV is a small plastic tube put into an arm vein. They will get avelumab every 2 weeks for 2 doses. Then they will get radiation each day for 5 days. They will continue to get avelumab every 2 weeks as long as they do not have bad side effects and the treatment is helping their disease.

Participants will have blood and urine tests, bone marrow biopsies, scans, and X-rays repeated during the study.

Participants will have a follow-up visit 30 days after their last treatment dose. Then they will have visits every 3-6 months for up to 5 years....Background:

* Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a hematologic neoplasm of the plasma cells defined by an M- protein greater than or equal to 3.0 g/dL or bone marrow plasma cells greater than or equal to 10% and presence of end-organ disease.
* Although significant advances in treatment have been made in the past decade, MM remains incurable with median survivals of 5-8 years.
* While therapeutic strides have been made with approvals of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), proteasome inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies, treatment of relapsed refractory MM (RRMM) remains an unmet need for patients who have exhausted available therapies.
* Extramedullary plasmacytomas arising either from focal bone involvement or from hematogenous spread occur in 7-18% of newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) with an additional 6-20% in RRMM.
* Immune checkpoint inhibitors are being evaluated in combination regimens and evidence exists that radiation therapy (XRT) may synergize with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Objectives:

- To assess the response rate of avelumab in combination with XRT (BavXRT) in RRMM patients with plasmacytomas or lytic lesions

Eligibility:

* Patients must have previously treated RRMM refractory to, ineligible for, or intolerant of available therapeutic regimens known to provide clinical benefit (e.g, immunomodulatory \[IMiD\], proteasome inhibitor, and anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)38 monoclonal antibody-based treatments).
* Presence of greater than or equal to 1 extramedullary plasmacytoma and/or lytic lesion amenable to XRT
* Age greater than or equal to 18 years
* Adequate organ function, and without serious comorbidity or disease (e.g., autoimmune disease), that would preclude concurrent systemic treatment or radiotherapy.

Design:

* Treatment will consist of a 4-week lead-in with avelumab, followed by concurrent XRT 5 gray (Gy) x 5 days). Monotherapy avelumab will continue indefinitely until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity; 28-day cycles.
* Routine safety and MM-specific clinical labs will be assessed. Additional research bloods will be collected for evaluating immune-subsets, endosomes, and peripheral blood T cell repertoire prior to and following treatment (lead-in and prior to XRT, at disease re- evaluations at at time of response \[i.e., complete remission (CR)/progressive disease (PD)\]).
* Bone marrow biopsies will be evaluated for Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1)/ligand 1 (L1) expression, and B and T cell subsets using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Flow cytometry will also be used to evaluate stimulatory and inhibitory immune subsets along with endosomes. Standard clinical histopathology and flow cytometry will also be evaluated.
* Single arm, Simon minimax two-stage phase II trial design. The first stage will enroll 13 patients; if futility is not met, second stage will enroll another 14 patients to define the response rate to BavXRT in this population.

It will be studied alone and then in combination with external beam radiotherapy. The study design includes six cohorts, Levels 1-6. The first three cohorts of participants will receive 153Sm-DOTMP alone, and if this is determined to be safe, subsequent cohorts will receive the radiopharmaceutical followed by external beam radiotherapy.This is a dose escalation study of a new radiopharmaceutical agent, 153Sm-DOTMP. Eligible participants will have osteosarcoma metastatic to bone, other solid tumors with bone metastases, or an unresectable localized osteosarcoma. Because of anticipated prolonged myelosuppression, participants will have a peripheral blood stem cell harvest. They will then be treated with 2 doses of 153Sm-DOTMP given 7 days apart. Twenty-four days after the initial dose, stem cells will be reinfused if needed. The first three cohorts of participants will receive only radiopharmaceutical. If Dose Level 3 is not the maximally tolerated dose (MTD), subsequent dose levels will include external beam radiotherapy, administered beginning on Day 15. The dose of external beam radiotherapy will be determined by dosimetry studies performed after each administration of study agent, and will be targeted to a tumoricidal dose of radiation.

"A Single-arm, Phase II Clinical Trial to Treat Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer With Induction Chemotherapy Plus Anti-PD-1 Therapy Followed by Radiotherapy Plus Concurrent Anti-PD-1 TherapyThe goal of this Phase 2 trial is to evaluate a non-surgical bladder-preserving treatment mode which consists of induction chemotherapy plus anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) therapy followed by radiotherapy plus concurrent anti-PD-1 therapy. The main questions it aims to answer are: (i) whether the anti-PD-1 antibody, toripalimab, is effective in treating muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), when combined with chemoradiation; (ii) whether toripalimab is safe in combination with chemoradiation. Participants will receive 3 cycles of induction treatment containing chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin/carboplatin, plus toripalimab. Then the ones without progressive disease will receive radical radiotherapy plus 2 cycles of concurrent toripalimab.Bladder cancer is the second most common malignancies over the world. At initial diagnosis, the cases with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) accounts nearly 20% of all bladder cancer patients. And 40% of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer could develop to MIBC. Currently, radical cystectomy (RC) is the golden standard to manage MIBC. Yet, it brings severe surgical injuries and post-surgical complications which impair life quality of the patients. Recently, bladder-preserving treatment based gradually becomes the second choice for MIBC. It consists of maximal transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) and chemoradiation. A series of clinical trials and meta-analyses supported that the bladder-preserving treatment has a similar therapeutic effect compared with RC. But it is noteworthy that this treatment mode does not really avoid surgery. TURBT could also cause complications, such as haemorrhage, infection, perforation, and even tumor dissemination. Moreover, the incidence of serious toxicities brought by concurrent chemoradiation is as high as 36%. In actual clinical work, it is hard for more than half patients to complete chemoradiation of standard intensity. Additionally, many patients are unsuitable for bladder preservation, including those with T stage \> T2, diameter \> 5 cm, hydronephrosis and positive lymph nodes. Hence, it calls for improvement of current bladder preservation mode, to make more MIBC patients receive radical treatment which brings better therapeutic experience and life quality.

Many lab studies indicated that formation and progression of bladder cancer is a process of mutation accumulation. It provides biological fundamentals for immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) antibodies. Based on available clinical studies, anti-PD-1 antibodies exhibits ideal therapeutic effects in bladder cancer of different stages and has an incidence of toxicities as low as 13%. Its toxicities mainly include arthralgia and hyponatremia, which are well tolerated. Currently, there are more than 10 clinical trials trying anti-PD-1 antibodies for bladder preservation. However, the treatment modes in most of them still contain TURBT. This phase 2 trial intended to evaluate the therapeutic and adverse effects of a non-surgical bladder-preserving treatment mode consisting of anti-PD-1 antibodies and chemoradiation, in a small patient cohort with MIBC. The results might provide an effective, non-invasive and low-toxic choice which improves patient experience and realizes bladder preservation.";FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;TRUE;TRUE;FALSE;FALSE;Other;FALSE;;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE

"A Phase I/II Study of Total Body Irradiation, Thiotepa, and Fludarabine as Conditioning for Haploidentical CD34+ Purified Peripheral Blood Stem Cell TransplantsRATIONALE: Chemotherapy, such as fludarabine and thiotepa, and radiation therapy may destroy cancerous blood-forming cells (stem cells) in the blood and bone marrow. Giving healthy stem cells from a donor whose blood closely resembles the patient's blood will help the patient's bone marrow make new stem cells that become red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of total-body irradiation, fludarabine, and thiotepa and to see how well they work in treating young patients who are undergoing a donor stem cell transplant for hematologic cancer.OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the safety of a conditioning regimen without anti-thymocyte globulin comprising total body irradiation, thiotepa, and fludarabine followed by CD34-positive-selected haploidentical allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in young patients with life-threatening hematologic malignancies.

Secondary

* Determine the risk for severe graft-vs-host disease in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the kinetics of immune reconstitution in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the risk for life-threatening infections in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE:

* Conditioning regimen: Patients 7 years of age and under undergo total body irradiation twice daily on days -9 to -7. Patients over 7 years of age undergo total body irradiation once on day -7. All patients receive fludarabine IV once daily on days -6 to -2 and thiotepa IV over 2 hours twice on day -5.
* CD34-positive (CD34+)-selected haploidentical allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT): Patients undergo CD34+-selected allogeneic PBSCT on days 0 and 2.

Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or CNS disease also receive methotrexate intrathecally twice before transplantation and 4 times after day 35 post-transplantation. Male patients with lymphoid malignancies undergo additional radiotherapy to the testes.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for at least 100 days, at 1 year, and then periodically thereafter.
